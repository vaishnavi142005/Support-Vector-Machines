# Support Vector Machine Classification

## Objective
To classify binary data using SVM with linear and RBF kernels.

## Steps:
1. Loaded Breast Cancer dataset.
2. Split into train/test sets and standardized features.
3. Trained SVM models with linear and RBF kernels.
4. Evaluated accuracy and generated classification reports.
5. Visualized decision boundaries in 2D.
6. Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
7. Applied cross-validation for model evaluation.

## Results:
- Linear Kernel Accuracy: XX%
- RBF Kernel Accuracy: XX%

## Tools:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
